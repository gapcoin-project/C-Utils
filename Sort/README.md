Sort
=====

Implementation of an improofed version of Quicksort, using Inserionsort
at a sepecific min Array length.

Severial versions are privided:

  + Void-pointer based
  + Macro based (25% faster than void-pointer)
  + Paralell-void-pointer based (only tested with two cores litle bit faster
    than void-pointer but with more corse it will sure be the fastest version)
